motion layout demo

This repo is written for the try, develop motion on Android.

There is nothing on the code. Android is making all the work. I just declared the start and end positions of objects in activity_main_scene.xml file. 

And added some little configurations to try Motion Layout's power.

This repo is not for production. Just demo project.
